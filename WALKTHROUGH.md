# Life Organizer App - Walkthrough

## Overview
I have successfully initialized the **Life Organizer App** and aligned it with your detailed Professional Practicum requirements.
The project is connected to GitHub, the documentation is comprehensive, and the code structure matches your specifications exactly.

## 1. Project Documentation
The file `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` has been updated with your full "Professional Practicum Write-up" content, making it ready for submission.
[View Documentation](file:///c:/Users/nicol/life_organizerapp.git/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## 2. GitHub Repository
The complete source code and documentation are pushed to:
**https://github.com/nicolefagan54/Life_Organizer_App**

## 3. Application Structure
The folder structure has been refactored to match your request:
- **Controllers**: `DashboardController`, `HomeController`, etc.
- **Services**: `TaskService`, `HealthService`, `CalendarService`, `NotificationService`.
- **Views**: `Dashboard/Index.cshtml` (Main Overview), `Home/Index.cshtml` (Home Life).

## 4. Running the App
The application builds and runs successfully.
- **Dashboard**: Displays Health, Today's Tasks, and Upcoming Events.
- **Home Life**: Placeholder for Chores and Bills module.

## Next Steps
- Implement specific logic for `HealthController` and `WorkController` views.
- Expand `TaskService` and `HealthService` with full CRUD operations.
- Styles can be further customized in `wwwroot/css/site.css`.
